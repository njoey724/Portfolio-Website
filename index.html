                <h3>Hi, my name is Joey!</h3>
                <p>I am learning and growing while enjoying this journey we call Life.  I want to take a minute to share some things about me:</p>
                    <div>
                        <ul> <!--created an unordered list to share things about myself-->
                            <li>I am a cultivation technician and I work in a cannabis cultivation facility.</li>
                            <li>I am a student at Thinkful, growing my knowledge and learning everything there is to know about coding.</li>
                            <li>I am located in Hayward, California.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>As a cultivation technician I understand the importance of growing and learning new things to make the most of your life.  I have grown to love coding as much as I love cultivation and so I decided to become a student at Thinkful.  I find it so exciting to write code that becomes something much more amazing when it is displayed in a web page.  I also love to collaborate with others, so don't be shy, send me a message.</p>
                        <p>Aside from coding and cannabis cultivation, I have a passion for cooking and skateboarding.  There's nothing like going out for a nice cruise on the skateboard, then coming home and cooking a delicious meal to enjoy after working up an appetite!</p>
